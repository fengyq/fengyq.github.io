# Research

Our research focuses on uncovering the genetic mechanisms underlying human evolution, phenotypic diversity, and disease susceptibility. We employ an integrative approach combining population genetics, functional genomics, and bioinformatics to identify and characterize functional mutations and their target genes.

## Research Areas

### 1. Non-coding Variants in Human Traits and Diseases
- Developing and applying high-throughput methods to identify functional non-coding variants
- Investigating the role of regulatory elements in human complex traits
- Integrating multi-omics data to understand gene regulation mechanisms

### 2. Population Genetics and Human Evolution
- Studying genetic adaptation of cardiac traits in diverse human populations
- Analyzing genetic variants involved in skin pigmentation and local adaptation

### 3. Functional Genomics and CRISPR Technology
- Developing CRISPR-based methods for genome editing and screening
- Utilizing MPRA and Hi-C to study gene regulation
- Implementing bioinformatics pipelines for genomic data analysis

## Current Projects

### Genetics underlying human heart evolution and diseases
- Investigating the evolution of cardiac traits
- Analyzing population-specific variants and their functional impacts
- Developing therapeutic strategies for cardiac diseases

### African Skin Pigmentation Genetics
- Identifying genetic variants influencing skin pigmentation
- Studying the evolutionary history of pigmentation genes
